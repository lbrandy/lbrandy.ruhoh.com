My name is Louis Brandy. I am a software engineer who works at a startup company in Pittsburgh. We do <a href="http://www.pittpatt.com">face recognition and face tracking</a>. I can be contacted at <strong>louis@lbrandy.com</strong>.

I attended the University of Florida where I graduated with three degrees. Two Bachelors of Science (one in Electrical Engineering and the other in Computer Engineering) and a Master of Science (from the Department of Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering. Confusing. I know.). My focus in grad-school was on intelligent machines with a healthy dose of computer architecture.

Please don't take anything I say too seriously.
