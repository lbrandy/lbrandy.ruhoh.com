My wife is an optometrist. She knows as much as you'd expect an optometrist wife of a programmer to know, and then a fair bit more. She uses a mac. She can power cycle a router with the best of them. She recently got a printer working on an internet-less machine running windows 95. That's not half bad.
<h3>Some choice quotes</h3>
<strong>On World of Warcraft</strong>: "This must be the worst game of all time. You spend twenty minutes dressing your wizard and then when you finally kill something you spend ten more minutes trying on all their clothes."

<strong>On her favorite blog post of mine</strong>: "It's <a href="http://lbrandy.com/blog/2008/10/my-first-and-last-webcomic/">the one about the jpeg and png</a>. It has cartoons."

<strong>On SQL queries</strong>: "Can you please explain to me the thing with the eskimo queers?"
<h4>Today at Best Buy</h4>
her: Hey, didn't you say you wanted a KGB cable?

me: Uhmmm... kgb.. what could that possibly mean

her: So you can switch between...

me: Ohhh! A KVM switch. And yes, I did want one.

Ha! She remembered. Thank god one of us did.
<h3>One time we were out</h3>
One point not too long ago we were at a bar, and my wife was meeting some friend of one of her friends. This guy didn't know who either of us was nor what we did. I wasn't really part of the conversation but just overheard it, it was classic:

<em>guy:</em> Yea, I'm software engineer.

<em>her:</em> Oh, wow, I do all programming in linux

<em>guy (really suspicious):</em> Oh really? What languages do you use?

<em>her: </em>C++ and python, mostly.

<em>guy (astonished): </em>Wait.. are you serious? In Linux? Really?

<em>her: </em>Yea, it's way faster. I can't handle windows... too much mouse....

<em>her:</em> .. and also I love the penguin

His eyes were all lit up. She was basically bullshitting him. She's done this more than once. She's learned a ton about programming (without actually learning it) and picked up much of the lingo. When someone trips her up, she asks a bunch of questions so she doesn't get fooled the next time.Â  For whatever reason, they are always extremely skeptical until she hits them with the penguin line. That seems to seal the deal.
