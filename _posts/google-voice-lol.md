It would appear the recent "migration" emails that google apps has been sending me weren't messing around. At some point my "apps" got migrated, and with it went my google voice number. None of my google voice accounts show the google-voice number anymore, the number no longer forwards to my phone, and there appears to be no way to get it back. Google just turned my phone off. The best part is I still get emails for the account that apparently has the phone number (it thinks my account name is: louis%<a href="http://lbrandy.com/" target="_blank">lbrandy.com</a>@<a href="http://gtempaccount.com/" target="_blank">gtempaccount.com</a>)Â hooked up, but I can't actually log into it, or use it, or transfer it. At least no way I can figure out.

So the very reason for google's voice attractiveness (existence?), to save me the pain of having to update people with new phone numbers, appears to have backfired gloriously.
