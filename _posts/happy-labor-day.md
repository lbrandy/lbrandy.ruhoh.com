No real post this weekend. I'm out of town for a wedding.

Instead, I did a bunch of blog maintenance. Since <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/09/05/security-threat-wordpress-under-attack/">TechCrunch decided that wordpress is under attack</a>, I decided to upgrade my wordpress install to the latest version. That turned into a disaster because I installed some automatic update plugin that wasn't working properly. So I decide to go with a clean svn version of the newest tagged wordpress and migrate everything over.

I also turned on Akismet instead of using recaptcha since people kept complaining about it. No idea how that's going to work out but, to be honest, I don't have high hopes.

I also spent a bunch of money to improve my computer setup at home. I looked at a ton of reviews on DVI/USB KVM switches and they all seem to be terrible. I had no idea KVM technology was so complicated.
