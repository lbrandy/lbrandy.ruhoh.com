There are many dumb interview questions. Programming, itself, has a wide range of extra potential for stupidity. But the question that irks me the most is universal to just about every field:

<em><strong>What is your greatest weakness?</strong></em>

Well, my greatest weakness is a complete and utter intolerance for inane questions. You see, this stupid question is designed to be rightly answered by someone who has carefully crafted an answer that turn some apparent weakness into a perceived strength. Maybe I work too hard. Maybe I care too much. Maybe sometimes I am too passionate. Blah, blah, blah. What have we learned about each other? Well, first, we've learned that you somehow believe in this stupid question. Secondly, we've learned that I've read a website on how to give a trite, non-committal answer that conveys absolutely no information. Do you honestly believe that I'm a perfectionist?

It's a game. You are asking me a question to see if I've learned how to properly not answer it. What a joke. This question is just a vapid mating ritual, void of any real information. We are like a pair of insects. You shake your little antennae and I gotta make sure I do the proper mating dance or you're just going to eat me.

Why are we playing this game? Is it just to make sure we are all "in" on the game? Is this the business world's equivalent of a modem handshake? You just want to make sure I haven't been living under a rock? Maybe we can replace this waste of time with some secret hand signals or something. You tap your foot three times, and I respond with two eye brow raises. It'll save the time and communicate the same information. We both know the ritual.

On second thought, my greatest weakness is that I don't have the fortitude of my principles to tell you straight-away that this question is asinine and I feel the need to give a long detailed explanation of why such inanity has no value.

Now that we've established that you can ask the standard questions and I've prepared carefully crafted (and likely untrue) responses, can we move on? Or do I need to keep dancing?
<h3>In the Negative?</h3>
Some people might argue that the question (and others like it) are valuable in the "negative" direction. In other words, bad answers help you eliminate bad people. I guess. I haven't spent many years asking these types of questions to know how often you receive horrible answers. I wonder how many times, honestly, that a candidate would have gotten a job except he named his greatest weakness as clubbing baby seals.

My suspicion is that anyone incapable of getting the basic interview rituals correct had red flags all over the place.
