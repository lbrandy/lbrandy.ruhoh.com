Excellent communication skills are, by far, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=ko7&amp;q=site%3Ajobs.joelonsoftware.com+%22communication+skills%22&amp;btnG=Search">the most required qualification in the software development world</a>. There's just simply no other way of saying it. Many even say that communication skills are the most important skill a developer can have, trumping even technical skills.

Communication skills are completely and utterly overrated for the position of software developer. There. I said it. Look at the job listings: if you don't have top notch written and verbal communication skills, you can't get a job as a software developer. Please reread that last sentence and try not to laugh.

Communication skills are important, sure, but let's not buy into this level of blogger hysteria.

The idea that communication skills trump programming skills is a snarky thought-provoking idea that makes for good blog posts. It's appealing as an idea because it goes against what you might consider conventional wisdom. But it's total nonsense. The single most important attribute that a software developer can possess is, without question: <strong>aptitude</strong>. There's never been a superstar programmer who got fired because he was lousy with keynote (ahem, or powerpoint). They just find someone else to give the talk, and let him code. Good companies work extremely hard in their interviewing process to divine aptitude. They know what they are doing. No one ever went into a Google interview and had to write an essay. (I just made that up. I presume it's true.)

<strong>If you think communication skills might be the most important skill for a developer, you either haven't worked with a bad programmer, or... are one.</strong>

Now I'm not saying they aren't important. They are. It's just that they are overrated. Here's why they are important:
<h3><strong>1a. Easy to Judge -- Getting a Job</strong></h3>
Programmer aptitude is notoriously difficult to figure out from a simple interview. The salient point here is that when all else is roughly equal, the ease of judging communication skills serves as the greatest tiebreaker. Having good communication skills will help you get jobs.

<h3><strong>1b. Easy to Judge -- First Impressions</strong></h3>
People's impression of you is going to be entirely predicated upon your communication skills. Your resume will get thrown in the garbage if it conveys that you lack good writing skills. From day one, your co-workers will judge you based on your interpersonal and verbal communication skills. They have literally nothing else to go on. For a few months you'll likely be floundering around in the new code base, doing odds and ends, and slowly getting up to speed. Even if you are an all-star, only your nearest peers will ever notice you have any talent at all.

Slowly, though, that will change. People will talk behind your back. They'll start saying things like "Johnny's pretty good" (or bad...). This will eventually work its way to management, and around the organization. A year (or two) later, your immediate organization will have a better professional picture of you. It literally takes a year to overcome those initial opinions about you. At that point, sadly, it might even be too late.

Because aptitude is so difficult to judge, communication skills are so easy to judge, and both correlate roughly with intelligence, it can be argued that passing judgement on your aptitude based on your communication skills is statistically more effective than.. say... flipping a coin. Right or wrong, that is the reality of the situation.
<h3><strong>2. Improvability</strong> (...is a word, I promise)</h3>
It's much, much harder to become a better programmer than a better communicator (this is a topic for another day). TAKE ADVANTAGE. Since most people will equate them, you can use this particular equation to your benefit. Improving your communication skills improves your perceived aptitude.<strong> Just don't kid yourself that your insanely good technical writing skills are going to save your job as a developer if you introduce bugs faster than you can fix them.</strong>
<h3><strong>3. Versatility</strong></h3>
The heart of the issue though is that being a good communicator makes you much more versatile inside the organization. Not everyone can be the superstar programmer that is better left alone when presentation time rolls along. More importantly, good communicators can branch out into different things. They can become software managers. They can become project managers or system analysts. They can deal with customers. It gives you a much greater ability to move both vertically and laterally inside any organization. If big organizations aren't your thing, how about this: it makes you a far, far, far better software entrepreneur. Company founders have to wear many hats and communication skills become critical.
<h4>4. Greatness</h4>
It is also often said that great programmers are great because of their communication skills. This is probably true. Sadly, people have mistakenly taken the converse to also be true (that great communication skills make you a great programmer). The problem here is that top-notch coding skills <strong>come first, not second.</strong>

I can agree with this statement. But let's be clear: Linux wouldn't have succeeded if Torvalds didn't also have superb technical skills. I'm fairly certain no one would be using Linux if the primary qualifications of its developers was their communication skills.
