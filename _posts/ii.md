<p>The square root of negative one is an imaginary number named<code> i</code>. I presume most you already know that. One of the most famous results in all of mathematics is this little fact about some of our favorite constants:
</p>
<code style="font-size:18px">e<sup>iπ</sup> = -1</code>
<p>
Here's a lesser known but equally stunning little fact about our friend: <code>i<sup>i</sup> </code> has a real numbered answer (well, infinitely many, if you want to be technical about it, but I'm going to skirt that issue.) Yes, it's true. <code>i<sup>i</sup> </code> equals about 0.2. Ask google. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=i^i">See for yourself.</a></p>

It's fairly trivial to show, actually:
<table style="font-size:18px" border="0" cellspacing="20"> 
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>e<sup>iπ</sup> = -1</code></td>
<td><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_identity">Euler's Identity</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>e<sup>½iπ</sup> = i</code></td>
<td>take the square root of both sides.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>e<sup>½(i*i)π</sup> = i<sup>i</sup></code></td>
<td>raise both sides to the i<sup>th</sup> power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>e<sup>-½π</sup> = i<sup>i</sup></code></td>
<td>because i*i = -1</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
