Vacation means no writing for me this weekend. But just for content's sake, here's some movie reviews.

<strong>Angels &amp; Demon</strong>: A conspiracy thriller centered on religion vs. science. It's a pretty good conspiracy thriller. The science/religion part is really weak. The science part, especially, is eye-rolling.

<strong>Star Trek</strong>: Awesome. Even my wife liked it. Highly entertaining. Characters are awesome. I hope they make more.
