I am cursed with either high expectations or awful slide making skills.

This graph is actually only partially correct (I don't have until October to get it right). It leaves out the cycles where I add 10 slides in a half hour, then spend the next 3 hours rewording and reworking them until only 1 and a half are left. And then I repeat that cycle a few more times.
