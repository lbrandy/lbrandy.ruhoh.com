So I made some simple updates to the site...
<ol>
	<li>Decided to tag my small (useless) posts with BTW. Seems like a good idea. I'll still do the full ones on Mondays.</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Removed the email field for comments. Totally useless. I don't want them. You don't want to enter them. </span>Made sure they are more obviously optional. Useful for gravatars, only, though. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">
</span></li>
	<li>Made sure people understand the "website" field is optional. No need to put in gibberish. Mostly for me. Anyone who enters a website, and comments here, I tend to follow it to see what other people are saying or doing. I don't like following gibberish links.</li>
	<li>Made lbrandy.com redirect to the blog.</li>
	<li>Added comment total to the archive. Again, for me.</li>
	<li>Backup plugin. No one cares.</li>
</ol>
and the real reason I made this little oh by the way post:

**7. I've disabled trackbacks for my new posts.** They are a great idea, in theory, but in practice... ugh... virtually none of the ones I've received have been useful. If you write a blog response to anything I've written, please post the link in a comment. I'd love to read and reply to anyone whose taken the time to respond to anything I've written.
