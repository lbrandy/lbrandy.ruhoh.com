	<li>The reason we invented civilization is so you can do one thing really well, and give money to other people to do everything else for you. I discovered this during my move. Movers charge a lot of money. They are worth it.</li>
	<li>There is no such thing as one-coat paint. Don't believe the hype.</li>
	<li>People you know in real life will mock you if you write a blog. As they should.</li>
	<li>Don't write something you don't believe, just to be provocative. People who don't know you that well might take it seriously.</li>
	<li>Never trust an Austrian talking about power.</li>
	<li>The more people who go to a meeting, the more efficient it is. I have no idea how. I can't explain this.</li>
	<li>Hard consonants are funny. If you need an arbitrary noun for a joke, choose one with good hard consonants. Tuesday is the best day. Seventeen is a good number. James K Polk. Buicks. This also explains why a well-placed 'fuck' makes jokes better.</li>
	<li>The egg came first. I've seen through the bullshit.</li>
	<li>I have never been more wrong about anything in my life than twitter. Sorry twitter. Good luck Iran.</li>
	<li>I am still correct about the vast majority of twitterers.</li>
