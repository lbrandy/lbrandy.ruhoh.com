If you spend all day doing it, when you get home, you really don't want to do anything else.

Like, for example, write a blog post.

I know that joke was lame but look on the bright side, at least you didn't get a lame analogy where I seriously tried to connect moving and programming.

So, we've bought a new house. It was a good time. We got an interest rate below 5%, a great price, and Pittsburgh has been rated the best place to buy instead of rent by CNN/Money. We are paying about as much in mortgage as we've been paying in rent. So off we go, painting, and cleaning, and packing, and moving. And that means anything I write will be full of exhaustion and anger. Like normal, you might say.  At any rate, I'll be back in two weeks, at the latest.
