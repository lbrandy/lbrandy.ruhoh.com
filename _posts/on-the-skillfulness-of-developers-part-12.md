I've looked at alot of resumes recently.
<br id="podl0" />Let me start with an observation: I am amazed at the number of people who think the more technologies and languages they know, the more attractive they become as a developer (or worse still, the better they are as a developer). Adding keywords to the soup that is your resume isn't beneficial. Although, in a self-defeating way, maybe the type of people who think adding more keywords to their resume deserve to work at the type of employers who agree. <br id="mkmk" /><br id="mkmk0" />This got me to thinking: along which dimensions are developers skillful, and how are resumes analyzed? I came up with three areas of<em> technical </em>skill. <a href="http://lbrandy.com/blog/2008/09/a-programmers-communication-skills/">Non-technical issues are left for a different day</a>.<br id="ado2" />
<ul>
	<li><strong>Expertise</strong> -- The specific knowledge about the domain in which you are currently working. A programmer with 10 years experience in Java probably has a high Java expertise.</li>
	<li><strong>Aptitude</strong> -- The ability to find, invent, connect and implement solutions to problems. A high-aptitude programmer is the one who has incredible instincts, always chooses the correct architecture or data-structure, and tracks down bugs no one else can.</li>
	<li><strong>Versatility</strong> -- The collection of (abstract) algorithms/solutions/concepts you've mastered and bring to any given problem. A programmer who has patches in the mainline linux kernel, has worked on several highly-scalable websites, and spent a few years writing highly parallel supercomputing applications would likely be very versatile.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Expertise: The Favored Dimension of Bad Jobs</h3>
Expertise is a special kind of experience that's extremely important in the day to day for a programmer. In fact, of our three dimensions, expertise in the problem at hand is probably the single most important in terms of your daily productivity. So it would make sense that some employers seem to stress this aspect. You need to be an expert at Java to get a Java job, right? And you need to have 5 years of experience in web development to do well at this company. <strong>It all makes sense, right? God no. No, it does not, not at all.
</strong>

I cannot believe how pervasive this logic is. Not long ago the reddit founder mentioned that he often hires people that don't know the language they use at reddit (Python).
<blockquote>I don’t think we’ve yet hired an employee who knew Python.
<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="http://us.pycon.org/2009/conference/schedule/event/80/">reddit foudner Steve Huffman</a></p>
</blockquote>
Some people found this comment surprising. Too many people. It seems too obvious to me that previous experience in a language is, at best, a small bonus. To some people, however, the idea of getting a job without knowing the language of the company seems sacrilegious (or dangerous, or amazing). I feel sorry for those people.<br id="tpu6" /><br id="tpu60" />There are three big problems with valuing expertise highly:<br id="tkih2" />
<ol>
	<li>A lack of relevant expertise can be remedied relatively quickly.</li>
	<li>Expertise will never make up for a lack of other vital programming skills.</li>
	<li>You can't be an expert on everything.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Lacking expertise is temporary. Very temporary.</h4>
An extremely smart developer from a varied background can become functional very, very quickly. He'll be an expert with Python in no time at all. Yes, there is some learning curve, but unless you plan on getting rid of someone after a month, there's absolutely no reason to worry about this. A lesser candidate with superior previous experience will be better for, at most, half a year (and that's being generous). The stronger candidate will be better forever after.
<h4>Lack of the other skills is (almost) forever.</h4>
Secondly, absolutely no amount of expertise is going to fix someone who lacks either of the other two key qualities. An expert programmer from a narrow background will miss solutions when faced with new problems. An expert programmer who lacks aptitude is, well, an oxymoron. What's really happened is he's fooled you with extensive experience but as it turns out, he's not all that good of a programmer. He has bad instincts and people spend far too much time cleaning up his messes. Ten years of making messes for other people to clean up is not experience we should value.
<h4>On "experience-centered" job requirements</h4>
Lastly, and maybe most importantly, comes the idea that not everyone can be an expert on everything. A simple thought experiment makes this clear. Somewhere out there is the greatest programmer who is alive today. He is brilliantly well rounded in both technical and non-technical skills. Chances are pretty high this programmer doesn't have the required set of experience you are looking for. That means your job search process has screened him out. How can we take any approach seriously when it removes the absolute best candidates in such a silly way? Can anyone seriously argue that this guy is an inferior candidate? Shouldn't we strive for a hiring process that at least grants the best programmer in the world an interview?

If you are one of those places that has hard experience requirements, you had better have a very good reason. Why, as a manager, would you ever devise a system where so many of the best people in a profession can't get the job you are offering? Especially when the switching costs are so low, when the missing experience is remedied so quickly.

I cannot figure out why people insist on hiring people with 3-5 years experience in their 5 favorite technologies. And for the life of me, I cannot figure out why programmers keep seeking out skills so they can get jobs at those places.
